# Case 3: Task

## The Challenge

An established e-commerce platform with 2M+ monthly users was facing a crisis: their aging platform couldn't keep up with modern expectations and competition.

### Critical Issues

**Performance Problems:**
- Page load time: **4.2 seconds** (industry standard: <2s)
- Mobile performance: **8+ seconds** on 3G
- Checkout abandonment: **73%**

**User Experience Debt:**
- Inconsistent design across 50+ pages
- Non-responsive layouts on 40% of pages
- Accessibility score: **52/100** (Lighthouse)

**Technical Debt:**
- Built on legacy jQuery codebase (8 years old)
- No component library or design system
- Slow feature development cycle (12+ weeks per feature)

## Stakeholder Objectives

### CEO Priorities
1. Stop losing market share to competitors
2. Reduce cart abandonment by 50%
3. Improve mobile conversion rate by 200%

## Business Context

### Market Position
- **Industry:** Fashion e-commerce

## Technical Assessment
