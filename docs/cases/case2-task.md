# Case 2: Task

## The Problem

A fintech startup approached us with a critical challenge: their investment platform was experiencing high user drop-off during the account creation and funding process.

### Key Issues

- **87% abandonment rate** during onboarding
- **Complex KYC process** taking average 15 minutes
- **Confusing funding options** - users didn't understand differences
- **Low trust signals** - users hesitant to link bank accounts

### Context

The company had recently secured Series B funding and needed to:
- Scale user acquisition rapidly
- Reduce customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Build trust with first-time investors
- Comply with financial regulations

## Business Requirements

### Must-Have Features

1. **Streamlined Onboarding**
   - Reduce steps from 12 to maximum 5
   - Auto-fill where possible using third-party APIs
   - Save progress and allow resume later

2. **Trust & Security**
   - Clearly communicate security measures
   - Display certifications and compliance badges
   - Two-factor authentication that doesn't frustrate

3. **Educational Content**
   - Help users understand investment products
   - Risk assessment questionnaire
   - Tooltips and contextual help

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Onboarding completion | 13% | 60%+ |
| Time to first deposit | 3.5 days | <24 hours |
| Support tickets | 280/week | <100/week |
| User trust score | 6.2/10 | 8.5+/10 |

## Competitive Analysis

We analyzed 8 major competitors and found:

- **Robinhood:** Fast onboarding but lacks educational content
- **Betterment:** Great education but too slow for experienced users
- **Wealthfront:** Excellent automation but confusing fee structure
- **Fidelity:** Comprehensive but overwhelming for beginners

### Opportunity Gap

None of the competitors successfully balanced:
- Speed for experienced users
- Guidance for beginners
- Trust-building throughout the flow

## Regulatory Requirements

Must comply with:
- **KYC (Know Your Customer)** - Identity verification required
- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** - Transaction monitoring
- **SEC regulations** - Risk disclosures and disclaimers
- **Data privacy** - GDPR, CCPA compliance

These requirements cannot be bypassed, but can be designed more elegantly.
