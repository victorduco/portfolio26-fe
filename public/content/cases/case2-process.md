# Process

## Discovery

Through extensive user research with employees across different departments and seniority levels, we identified key pain points in the existing communication flow. Conducted stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, and analyzed usage analytics to understand how teams were actually using the platform versus how we intended them to use it.

## Wireframing

Created low-fidelity wireframes to explore new navigation patterns and information architecture. Iterated rapidly through multiple concepts, testing different approaches to content organization, feature discoverability, and user flows. Collaborated closely with product managers and engineers to ensure technical feasibility while pushing for better UX.

## Prototype Evaluation and Testing

Built high-fidelity interactive prototypes and conducted usability testing sessions with 25+ users across different personas. Gathered feedback on key workflows, refined interaction patterns, and validated design decisions through A/B testing. Iteratively improved the design based on real user behavior and feedback before final implementation.
