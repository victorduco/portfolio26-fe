# UX Audit

## Task

The e-commerce platform suffered from severe usability issues that were driving customers away. Complex navigation made product discovery frustrating, the checkout flow had 7+ steps causing massive cart abandonment, and mobile experience was broken with tiny buttons and unresponsive layouts. Performance was abysmal with 8+ second load times on mobile, causing users to leave before pages even loaded.

## Building the Base

Conducted extensive usability testing with 30+ participants and analyzed top 10 competitors to identify industry best practices. Heat maps revealed friction points, scroll depth analytics showed content discovery issues, and competitor analysis identified key opportunities for differentiation in navigation, checkout flows, and mobile experience.
