# UX Audit

## The Problem

The e-commerce platform suffered from severe usability issues that were driving customers away. Complex navigation made product discovery frustrating, the checkout flow had 7+ steps causing massive cart abandonment, and mobile experience was broken with tiny buttons and unresponsive layouts. Performance was abysmal with 8+ second load times on mobile, causing users to leave before pages even loaded.

## User Testing

Conducted extensive usability testing with 30+ participants across different demographics and device types. Observed users struggling with basic tasks like finding products, adding items to cart, and completing purchases. Heat maps revealed users were clicking on non-interactive elements, scroll depth analytics showed most users never reached key content, and session recordings exposed critical friction points in the user journey.
